                <h1>Security</h1>

                <p>
                    For autofix.ci to work, you need to provide autofix.ci's GitHub App with read/write permissions
                    for your repository. Many maintainers are rightfully hesistant to provide such permissions to
                    third parties. We are taking this responsibility very seriously, and have designed
                    autofix.ci with security in mind from the start:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        autofix.ci has a well-defined threat model in which GitHub Actions runners are treated as
                        completely untrusted and potentially compromised. The autofix.ci API only enables the workflow
                        to update the current pull request once.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        autofix.ci's hosted service is written in a memory-safe language that emphasizes correctness
                        (Rust).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        autofix.ci minimizes untrusted input and data processing where possible. For example,
                        instead of using <samp>git checkout/apply/push</samp>, we have decided to use
                        GitHub's GraphQL API. This makes it much harder to port autofix.ci to other platforms,
                        but means we only need to process a
                        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/input-objects#filechanges">simple JSON
                            data structure</a>
                        instead of applying git commands on untrusted repositories.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        autofix.ci's main author has extensive practical (building security software, organizing and
                        playing CTF security competitions) and theoretical security experience (CS PhD
                        from a security group).
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Reporting a Vulnerability</h2>
                <p>
                    We ask that you do not report security issues to our normal GitHub issue tracker.
                    If you believe you've identified a security issue with autofix.ci, please report it to
                    {{ email("security@autofix.ci") }}.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you've submitted an issue via email, you should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours,
                    and depending on the action to be taken, you may receive further follow-up emails.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Bug Bounty</h2>
                <p>
                    For the responsible disclosure of critical vulnerabilities that could compromise the integrity or
                    confidentiality of our users' GitHub repositories, autofix.ci pays a bug bounty of up to one month
                    of autofix.ci's total revenue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will not bind you to any additional terms or have you sign an NDA when you report a
                    vulnerability. However, bounty payments, if any, will be determined by autofix.ci, in autofix.ci's
                    sole discretion. In no event shall autofix.ci be obligated to pay you a bounty for any submission.
                    If you are unhappy with how autofix.ci is handling the disclosure process, you may walk away at any
                    moment and publish your findings (but not any sensitive data you may have had access to) in the
                    public.
